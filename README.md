# TwitchAPIViewer
Twitch API using request string from FreeCodeCamp...limited functionality without Header ID.

This project was working with FreeCodeCamp's workaround API viewer due to problems with the API key.

The project works as of right now, with limited functionality and styling. Updates will include new features, such as toggling online/offline.

Also in consideration is the inclusion of an iframe link direct to stream.

If time allows, a branch will be set up to use my own api key and host on my website once my back-end knowledge is sufficient for the task.
